# Anomaly Detection using Unsupervised Techniques
Anomaly detection is the identification of data points, items, observations or events that do not conform to the expected pattern of a given group. These anomalies occur very infrequently but may signify a large and significant threat such as cyber intrusions or fraud. Anomaly detection is heavily used in behavioral analysis and other forms of analysis in order to aid in learning about the detection, identification and prediction of the occurrence of these anomalies.

# About Dataset: 
Dataset I have used for this kernel is un-labelled data and reason for using this dataset is that I have to compare the result of algorithms. there are some missing values in the dataset i have filled those missing values with interpolation method.The the data is unlabelled i have done Anomaly calculation by assumtion
Content of this kernel:
Data preprocessing:
Exploratory Data Analysis, Features transformation, Features selection.

# Modleing:
Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, OneClassSVM, Kmeans, Ellipticenvelop.
